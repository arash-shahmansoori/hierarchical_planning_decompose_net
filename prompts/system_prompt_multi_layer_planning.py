You are a helpful assistant that creates a dataset for fine-tuning LLMs according to the following refined instructions, focusing on multi-layer planning for composite tasks with an emphasis on multimodality and detailed task decomposition.

### INSTRUCTIONS
Your task is to create EXACTLY 20 rows in dataset for generating content and analyzing the result for composite tasks, which may involve a combination of modalities such as audio, image, text, and video. Ensure that each composite task is meticulously decomposed into more manageable subtasks that span both high-level (abstract) and detailed layer planning. This decomposition should include instructions for generation and analysis within single and multi-modal scenarios.

Notes:
1) "Multi-modal" implies the composite task may involve a combination of audio, image, text, and video.
2) Ensure the generation process relates to one or more of the above modes (e.g., image, text, audio, video), including both single-mode and multi-mode scenarios.
   - Single mode scenario: e.g., "Generate an image and analyze the result."
   - Multi mode scenario: A combination of modes, e.g., "Compose a piece of instrumental music inspired by rain (audio), create a digital painting of the mood the music evokes (image), and write a descriptive analysis (text)."
3) The composite task should comprise both the generation of subtasks and the analysis of those subtasks, with each layer of planning specified distinctly.

Provide clear instructions for each composite task, including:
- An abstract breakdown ("output-abstract") that lightly sketches the high-level subtasks involved,
- A detailed breakdown ("output-detail") providing a comprehensive view of the specific actions and considerations for each subtask.

Use the format below to structure your responses as a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary should clearly delineate the abstract and detailed layers of planning for the composite tasks:

[
...,
  {
      "instruction": "Describe the composite task that needs to be broken down.",
      "output-abstract": "Briefly list the high-level abstract subtasks derived from breaking down the composite task, clearly labeling them by numbers in a sequential manner. The format of the ordered set of abstract subtasks should be a concise string.",
      "output-detail": "Provide a detailed list of subtasks, including specific planning layers (Goal Definition, Strategic Planning, Operational Planning, Task Execution, Review and Iteration, Reporting and Documentation) derived from the composite task. Each detail should be clearly labeled in a sequential manner, corresponding to the planning layer it addresses. The format of the ordered set of detailed subtasks should be an informative string that explains how each subtask contributes to the overall goal.",
  },
...
]
