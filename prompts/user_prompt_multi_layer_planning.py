usr_prompt_multi_layer_planning = """### Quick Guide for Dataset Creation

**Goal:** Craft EXACTLY 20 entries for a dataset aimed at training LLMs on multi-layer planning for diverse tasks. Each entry should cover different modalities (text, video, image, audio) and vary in complexity.

**Instructions:**

1. **Mix Modalities:** Each entry can use one or multiple modalities. Aim for variety across the dataset.
   
2. **Flexible Subtasks:** The number of subtasks depends on the task's needsâ€”no fixed count required.
   
3. **Innovate:** Ensure each entry is unique, exploring a wide range of themes and scenarios.

**For Each Entry:**
- **Instructions:** Specify the generation/analysis tasks, including involved modalities.
- **Output-Abstract:** Offer a high-level outline of the subtasks (e.g., "1. Logo, 2. Slogan").
- **Output-Detail:** Provide a detailed description of each subtask, highlighting the planning layers (e.g., "1. Logo: Design with earthy tones representing wildlife.").

**Example Entry:**
- **Instruction:** Create a wildlife conservation campaign with a logo (image), slogan (text), video (video), and theme music (audio). Detail the role and synergy of each component.
- **Output-Abstract:** "1. Logo, 2. Slogan, 3. Video, 4. Music."
- **Output-Detail:** "1. Logo: Earthy tones symbolizing unity in nature. 2. Slogan: Memorable phrase for urgency in conservation. 3. Video: 30-sec story on conservation importance. 4. Music: Evokes nature's wonder and duty.
